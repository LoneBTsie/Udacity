# (Prosper Loan Data Exploration)
## by Lone B. Tsie


## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 113 937 loan recipeints, including income, credit score, date of purchase and other loan qualities. The dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv) with it's documentation available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration i found that there was a strong positive correlation between loan amount and monthly payment. The relationship is linear between these two confirming that the highest he loans the higher the monthly payments. Additionally, I found that there was no direct correlation between credit score and the loan amount. Furthermore, I investigated the relationship of income to loan amount received and whether these influenced whether the loan was completed or defaulted. It appears that the status of the loan is not dependent on income as both were more likely as income increased. Lastly, i investigates the number of loans and how many they were based on when they were acquired, showing that most loans are given at the first and fourth quarter and that over the years the number of loans have increased, bar from the drop during the 2008 to 2010 period which could be a result of the recession.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I focus on the influence of income and credit score on loans, status of loans taken based on income and loan amount as well as the frequency of loans over time.

I start by running frequencies on the income of the loan recipients to see if there is any notifiable pattern. Afterwards I investigated the trend of loans over the years to see popularity of loans over time. Lastly, I compared the relationship between income range and loan amount on the status of the loan, to determine whether there is a correlation or if the ability of a recipient to pay of the loan is dependent on some other reason not identified.
